        <h1>Taekwondo</h1> 
        <p>Taekwondo is something I've started since I was 5. I started competing at 9
          and was on the national team for 5 years. It taught me discipline, perserverance and
           how to deal with failure. I met many life-long friends throughout my time doing taekwondo.

        <h1>Ultimate Frisbee</h1> 
        <p>I started playing frisbee when I was in highschool and played all throughout my time there.
           It taught me the fundamental roles and skills in order to work in a team. It allowed me to learn 
           how to be a team player and play a supportive role.</p>

        <h1>Software Development</h1> 
        <p>My inspiration and love for software development came from video games and movies as many would.
           There has always been something intriguing and beautiful about being able to create something. I was never 
           much of an artist when it came to the paper and pen, or the paint brush. But to me, software development, is the same. 
           Software development is colorful, and is more than just 0s and 1s.

        <h1>Coaching</h1>
        <p>I enjoy coaching and helping my students who look up to me learn how to do skills that I've learned at their age.
          I am sharing my passion for taekwondo and martial arts by teaching kids how to do kicks and flips.</p>
